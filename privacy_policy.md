# Privacy Policy  
**Updated at 05/10/2025**

Misfah ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by Misfah. This Privacy Policy applies to our browser extension ("collectively, our Service"). By accessing or using our Service, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to our collection, storage, use, and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service.

## Information We Collect

1. **Local Usage Statistics:**  
   We collect anonymous usage statistics (number of filtered posts by category), which are stored locally on your device. These statistics are never transmitted to our servers.

2. **Extension Settings:**  
   Your preferences for content filtering are saved locally on your device using browser storage.

3. **Content Analysis:**  
   The extension analyzes text and images of posts on supported social media sites (X and Threads) to identify sensitive content.  
   - For **image analysis**, all processing happens locally on your deviceâ€”no image data is ever sent to external servers.  
   - For **text analysis**, we use Anthropic's Claude API to provide accurate and context-aware content filtering. This API call is made securely and only when text content needs to be analyzed. We do not store or retain any of the text content sent for analysis, and we only use the API response to determine if content should be filtered according to your preferences.

## How We Use Information

- Your settings and statistics are used solely to provide the extension's functionality.  
- We do **not** collect, transmit, or store any personal information or browsing data outside your device.  
- We do **not** use cookies or tracking technologies.

## Data Security

- All processing occurs locally on your device.  
- Most processing occurs locally on your device, particularly for image analysis.  
- Text analysis is performed using Anthropic's Claude API, with only the specific text content being analyzed sent securely.  
- Your preferences are stored in your browser's local storage and sync storage.

## Third-Party Services

We use the following third-party services:

- **Claude API:**  
  We use Anthropic's Claude API for text analysis to help identify content categories. When the extension analyzes text content, this data is temporarily processed through Anthropic's servers. No user identification information is sent with these requests, and the content is not stored permanently by Anthropic.

We do **not** integrate with any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising services. All user interaction data and preferences are stored locally on your device.

## Children's Privacy

Misfah is designed to create a safer social media environment by filtering out inappropriate content across platforms like Twitter/X and Threads. Our extension is particularly valuable for households wanting to protect younger users from exposure to sensitive content.

While the extension is intended for users of all ages, we recognize that parents and guardians may install it to create a safer browsing experience for children. The filtering categories (gambling, alcohol, violence, sexual content, etc.) help reduce exposure to inappropriate material.

We do **not** knowingly collect personal information from users of any age. Our extension operates entirely within the user's browser, with all filtering preferences stored locally on the device. The only data transmitted outside the browser is the content being analyzed through our Claude API integration, which processes text without collecting or storing personal information.

Parents should note that while Misfah provides valuable content filtering, no filtering solution is 100% perfect. We recommend adult supervision of children's internet activities as a complementary measure.

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Effective Date" at the top of this Privacy Policy.
